# Queen-Domination

Queen Domination, a project developed in C which assists in finding a solution for the n-Queen Problem using linked list. It uses a searching algorithm that deletes all the solutions which cannot occur. The deletion is done once the user chose the position  which reduces the solution space and makes the search easier for the later moves.
